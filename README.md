# polymer-morse-code
Morse code functions implemented in javascript and Web Audio
painstakingly wrapped in a web component user interface.

To use this, you will need to install bower, a package manager,
and then run "bower install" in the root of the project to download
all of the polymer code and components.  All of the components are
not necessary, but my bower.json file asks for them all.

Then you run a localhost http server in the root of the project so
it can fulfill all the link requests that loading the index.html page
will generate.

In the end, the whole application will boil down to a html file using
vulcanize, but not at the moment.
